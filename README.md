# The Odin Project: Etch-a-Sketch

This is a project to practice DOM manipulation by manippulating boxes in a grid and their behaviour on various actions.

## Known Bugs
- [ ] Setting size over 10 creates the wrong number of boxes and the grid is inaccurate

## Roadmap
- [ ] Randomize the squaresâ€™ RGB values with each interaction.
- [ ] Implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%. The goal is to achieve a fully black (or completely colored) square in only ten interactions.
- [ ] Give options to switch between the above two and the default grids to the user.
